#In a React application, the .env file is used to define environment variables that can be accessed throughout the application. These variables are typically used to store configuration settings or sensitive information that might vary between development, staging, and production environments.When you create a React app using Create React App (CRA) or a similar tool, it automatically generates a .env file for you. You can create different versions of this file, such as .env.development, .env.test, and .env.production, to specify environment variables for different stages of development.
